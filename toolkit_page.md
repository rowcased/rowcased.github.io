# Personal Developer Toolkit

While working on personal projects on my computer, I found out it was very convenient to have certain tools at my fingertips. I also realized I could just write them, so I did. Some of them are obsolete. Several were very useful. I learned a lot by creating them. Oh, I could go on about it.

1 [dirp](/dirp.md)&nbsp;&nbsp;\~&nbsp;&nbsp;takes in any Python object and pretty prints its directory items<br><br>
2 [lili](/lili.md)&nbsp;&nbsp;\~&nbsp;&nbsp;converts a list to a linked list or vice versa, depending on input type<br><br>
3 [namer](/namer.md)&nbsp;&nbsp;\~&nbsp;&nbsp;returns a string of the name of whatever object was passsed in<br><br>
4 [no_print](/no_print.md)&nbsp;&nbsp;\~&nbsp;&nbsp;temporarily disables the print function during a program<br><br>
5 [ip](/ip.md)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\~&nbsp;temporarily halts the program with an optional message<br><br>
6 [timer](/timer.md)&nbsp;&nbsp;\~&nbsp;&nbsp;times a function based on inputs and repetitions<br><br>
