# Personal Developer Toolkit

One of my favorite revelations about the art of coding came from wanting certain tools while working on personal projects on my computer and then realizing I could simply write those tools for myself. So I did, and it a success. Some of them are obsolete. Several were very useful. I learned a lot by creating them.

1 [dirp()](/dirp.md)&nbsp;&nbsp;\~&nbsp;&nbsp;takes in any Python object and pretty prints its directory items<br><br>
2 [dot()](/dot.md)&nbsp;&nbsp;\~&nbsp;&nbsp;prints dots to show progress of a process in increments of tenths<br><br>
3 [ip()](/ip.md)&nbsp;&nbsp;\~&nbsp;&nbsp;temporarily halts the program with an optional message<br><br>
4 [lili()](/lili.md)&nbsp;&nbsp;\~&nbsp;&nbsp;converts a list to a linked list or vice versa, depending on input<br><br>
5 [namer()](/namer.md)&nbsp;&nbsp;\~&nbsp;&nbsp;returns a string of the name of the object passsed to it<br><br>
6 [no_print()](/no_print.md)&nbsp;&nbsp;\~&nbsp;&nbsp;temporarily disables the print function during a program<br><br>
7 [timer()](/timer.md)&nbsp;&nbsp;\~&nbsp;&nbsp;times a function based on inputs and repetitions<br><br>
