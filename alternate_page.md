## Codewars.com

**Project description:** I have done at least four different kinds of thing on this website which I will describe in detail in the following catagories: solving, translating, creating, and moderating.

### 1. Solved 2,000 + challenges

And since I learned from the ground up, the quality of code found on the website may vary.

Here I put a piece of Python code for you to look at:

```python
def func():
    print("Hello, World!")
```

### 2. Had over 100 translations into the C language approved

Here is an equivalent piece of code in the C language:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

void func(void) {
    printf("HELLO WORLD\n");
}
```

### 3. Created 3 original kata code challenges

### 4. Served as a moderator in answering questions and repairing issues with faulty kata

Here I am going into detail about what it means to be a moderator on codewars. There is no pay, but the hours are good. I have no real authority, although I do have the power to make some changes. I like that I have earned the ability to alter things on the website, so I respect that power and tread very carefully.
