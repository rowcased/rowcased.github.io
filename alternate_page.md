## Codewars.com

This user-managed website offers thousands of interesting and well-structured code challenges in a variety of levels and topics and holds a high standard for quality content, thorough testing, and user accountability. The site refers to these challenes as "kata", taken from _Kendo_. At first I only solved kata in Python as I began learning to code. Eventually I decided to also study C, and soon began translating some of the Python kata I had solved into C into that langauge. After some experience with that I created several original kata which were all approved and are currently in use online. I have also learned how to quickly learn a new langauge by solving kata in JavaScript, C++, Ruby, C#, and Java. With the earned privilages of rank, I now may also serve the site as a moderator; creating or resolving issues, answering questions, as well as improving the site by directly live-editing the production code of other code author's kata material.

### 1. Solved Kata

2,834 total pieces of code.
2,019 distinct kata

Most of these kata were in Python at 1,632. JavaScript and C come next with 477 and 444 respectively. The sum of kata solved in Ruby, C++, C#, and Java is 281.

### 2. Translations

Codewars supports over 40 programming languages. A kata might have a version available in any number of these languages.
As part of my study of the C language, I started publishing translations of kata I had previsouly solved in Python. These translations are peer-reviewed. A moderator who is knowledgable in that language checks the work for errors. Once all issues are fixed by the translator, the moderator then can approve the translation for usage on the website. Most of the translations I wrote were approved, (some have just not been noticed, or the kata author in inactive). These 117 translations have been solved by users over 5,000 times overall. Currently, my translations amount to about 15% of the total kata on the Codewars website that are avaailable in the C language.

Here is a list of my approved [C Translations](/C_translations) currently active on the website.

Here I put a piece of Python code for you to look at:
```python
def add(a, b):
    c = a + b
    print("{} + {} = {}".format(a, b, c))
    return c
```
An here is an equivalent piece of code in the C language:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int add(int a, int b) {
    int c = a + b;
    printf("%d + %d = %d\n", a, b, c);
    return c;
}
```

### 3. Original Content

    1 is_sator_square
    The first kata was based on a stone tablet found at Pompeii. It was an example of a "sator quare"
    
    2 build_square
    This is the second one.
    
    3 mutations
    And the third.

### 4. Moderation

Because rank, did stuff... in answering questions and repairing issues with faulty kata
Here I am going into detail about what it means to be a moderator on codewars. There is no pay, but the hours are good. I have no real authority, although I do have the power to make some changes. I like that I have earned the ability to alter things on the website, so I respect that power and tread very carefully.
