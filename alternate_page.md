## Codewars.com

This user-managed website offers thousands of interesting and well-structured code challenges in a variety of levels and topics and holds a high standard for quality content, thorough testing, and user accountability. The site refers to these challenes as "kata", taken from _Kendo_. At first I only solved kata in Python as I began learning to code. Eventually I decided to also study C, and soon began translating some of the Python kata I had solved into C into that langauge. After some experience with that I created several original kata which were all approved and are currently in use online. I have also learned how to quickly learn a new langauge by solving kata in JavaScript, C++, Ruby, C#, and Java. With the earned privilages of rank, I now may also serve the site as a moderator; creating or resolving issues, answering questions, as well as improving the site by directly live-editing the production code of other code author's kata material.

### 1. Over 2,000 kata solved

Most of these kata were in Python.

### 2. Had over 100 translations into the C language approved

Here I put a piece of Python code for you to look at:
```python
def add(a, b):
    c = a + b
    print("{} + {} = {}".format(a, b, c))
    return c
```
An here is an equivalent piece of code in the C language:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int add(int a, int b) {
    int c = a + b;
    printf("%d + %d = %d\n", a, b, c);
    return c;
}
```

### 3. Created 3 original kata code challenges

    1 is_sator_square
    The first kata was based on a stone tablet found at Pompeii. It was an example of a "sator quare"
    
    2 build_square
    This is the second one.
    
    3 mutations
    And the third.

### 4. Served as a moderator

Because rank, did stuff... in answering questions and repairing issues with faulty kata
Here I am going into detail about what it means to be a moderator on codewars. There is no pay, but the hours are good. I have no real authority, although I do have the power to make some changes. I like that I have earned the ability to alter things on the website, so I respect that power and tread very carefully.
