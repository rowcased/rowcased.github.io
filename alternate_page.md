## Codewars.com

**Project description:** I have done at least four different kinds of thing on this website which I will describe in detail in the following catagories: solving, translating, creating, and moderating.

### 1. Solved 2,000 + challenges

Here I put a piece of Python code for you to look at:

```python
def funtion_name(argument):
    some_fib = [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13]
    while some_fib:
        yield some_fib.pop(0)
```

### 2. Had over 100 translations into the C language approved.

```c
int other_code() {
    int *pair = (int *) malloc(2 * sizeof(int));
    pair[0] = 42;
    pair[1] = 99;
    return result;
}
```

### 3. Created 3 original kata code challenges

### 4. Served as a moderator in answering questions and repairing issues with faulty kata.

Here I am going into detail about what it means to be a moderator on codewars. There is no pay, but the hours are good. I have no real authority, although I do have the power to make some changes. I like that I have earned the ability to alter things on the website, so I respect that power and tread very carefully.
