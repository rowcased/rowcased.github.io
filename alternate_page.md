## Codewars.com

#### The Site

Codewars is a prominent, user-driven website with a highly interactive community, offering thousands of coding challenges on a variety of topics in over 40 supported languages. The site borrows from Kendo; using a ‘kyu’ rank system and referring to challenges as ‘kata’. Points earned by activity on the site are considered _honor_. As increasing levels of honor are achieved, additional site privileges are granted to the user.

#### My involvement

At first I only solved kata in Python to just learn how to code, next I began C and translated kata into that language, then I added on additional languages, and eventually I created several original kata. While I was earning additional honor and advancing through the ranks, I unexpectedly evolved from user to contributor into an ad hoc site moderator.

### 1. Coder

Solving code challenges is main feature of the website. I solved a lot of them. I learned a lot while solving. You will see the good and the bad. Most of it was serious, some of it was play, some of it was art, but all of it was study.

* 2,967 total correct solutions
    * 2,033 is the base number of distinct solved kata
    *   943 represents resolving in multiple languages
```
1 Python     1,643
2 JavaScript   479
3 C            445
4 Ruby         104
5 C#            66
6 C++           63
7 Java          52
& 27 others    115
```

### 2. Translator

Codewars supports over 40 programming languages. A kata might have a version available in any number of these languages.
As part of my study of the C language, I started publishing translations of kata I had previously solved in Python into C for use on the website. Translations are peer-reviewed by a moderator knowledgable in the language. Once any issues are fixed by the translator, the moderator may approve the translation for use on the website. My 117 translations amount to about 18% of the total approved C kata on the site and have been collectively solved over 5,000 times worldwide.

Here is a list of my approved [C Translations](/C_translations) currently active on the website.

Here I put a piece of Python code for you to look at:
```python
def add(a, b):
    c = a + b
    print("{} + {} = {}".format(a, b, c))
    return c
```
An here is an equivalent piece of code in the C language:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int add(int a, int b) {
    int c = a + b;
    printf("%d + %d = %d\n", a, b, c);
    return c;
}
```

### 3. Creator

    1 is_sator_square
    The first kata was based on a stone tablet found at Pompeii. It was an example of a "sator square"
    
    2 build_square
    This is the second one.
    
    3 mutations
    And the third.

### 4. Moderator

moderator; in providing maintenance to kata, ranking beta submissions, and guiding new users.

Because rank, did stuff... in answering questions and repairing issues with faulty kata
Here I am going into detail about what it means to be a moderator on Codewars. There is no pay, but the hours are good. I have no real authority, although I do have the power to make some changes. I like that I have earned the ability to alter things on the website, so I respect that power and tread very carefully.

Along the way, I learned many things other than algorithms and data sets, such as maintainability, legibility, portability, optimization, documentation, unit testing, and many other fundamental principles of computer programming.

Eventually I decided to also study C, and later branched out into other languages such as JavaScript, C++, Ruby, C#, and Java. This taught me how to rapidly learn the basics of a new language.
As part of my study of the C language, I began translating kata I had previously solved in Python into C for use on the site. This taught me a lot about code structure, maintainability, legibility, and writing strong unit tests.
After some experience with that I created several original kata which were all approved and are currently in use online.
With the earned privileges of rank, I now may also serve the site as a moderator; creating or resolving issues, answering questions, as well as improving the site by directly live-editing the production code of other code author's kata material.
