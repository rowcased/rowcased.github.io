The site you are currenty navigating is one of my latest projects. I needed a basic way to present some code I'd been working on as part of my hiring strategy. While learning to use Github, I found a free template page and started adding to it. These are some technologies I studied in the process:

* Github
* basic markdown
* HTML
* CSS
* web design
