#### The Site

<!-- <a href="https://codewars.com">Codewars</a> -->
Codewars is a very active user-driven site offering thousands of code challenges in 48 languages. Borrowing from _Kendo_, challenges are called 'kata', a 'kyu' rank system is used, and points are known as 'honor'. As a member earns higher honor, they are granted additional site privileges.

#### My involvement

First I only <a href="https://rowcased.github.io/codewars.html#solver">solved</a> kata in Python to learn coding. C was next and I began <a href="https://rowcased.github.io/codewars.html#translator">translating</a> kata to that language. As my proficiency grew I added many new languages and started <a href="https://rowcased.github.io/codewars.html#creator">creating</a> original kata. While advancing through the ranks, I evolved from user to contributor into an ad hoc site <a href="https://rowcased.github.io/codewars.html#moderator">moderator</a>.

<h3 id="solver"><br>1. Problem Solver</h3>

I had zero skill when I first signed on. But I improved by studying other coders' solutions and reading comments about the kata. I found solving a kata in multiple languages offered invaluable insights into the nature of coding as well as how to learn a new language rapidly.



offered invaluable insights to coding.

I quickly learned how to study other coders' solutions and strove to learn better algorithm practices by studying other coders' solutions and reading comments. I used other tutorials and documentation to hone my skill. I especially found solving a kata in multiple languages offered invaluable insights to coding.

Being new to coding when I began Codewars, I found many kata baffling. Early solutions were inefficient or inelegant, but I strove to rapidly learn better algorithm practices by studying other coders' solutions. I found solving a kata in multiple languages offered invaluable insights to coding.

Being new to coding as I began Codewars, I was baffled by some challenges and some early solutions were inefficient. I rapidly learned about algorithm best practices by reading comments and studying other people's solutions. Solving a kata in multiple languages offered invaluable insights to coding. I never imagined I would solve so many kata and learn as much as I have.

<h3 id="translator"><br>2. C Translator</h3>

When I began C, I so was fascinated by how it differed from Python that I started creating translations into C for use on the site. I learned about code structure quality, and especially writing strong unit tests. I like the idea that coders around the globe are using my test suites to improve their skills.

* 132 ~ number of my [C translations available on Codewars](/C_translations)
* 19.4% ~ percentage these make of all 679 approved C kata
* 14,926 ~ number of valid solves made collectively worldwide

```python
# an example of a simple Python function
def say_hello(name):
    greet = "Hello, {}!".format(name)
    print(greet)
    return greet
```
```c
// the equivalent code translated to C
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <stdio.h>

char *say_hello(const char *name) {
    size_t n = strlen(name);
    char *greet = (char*) malloc((n+10) * sizeof(char));
    sprintf(greet, "Hello, %s!\n", name);
    printf("%s", greet);
    return greet;
}
```

<h3 id="creator"><br>3. Kata Creator</h3>

Codewars is built on user contributions. New kata begin in a beta stage, being scrutinized by moderators. Issues must be resolved and satisfaction must reach 80% prior to approval. Many never make it out of beta; it's hard to create new material for a site with over 8,000 kata! All three of mine were approved and were also translated to new languages by other members.

1 [is_sator_square](https://rowcased.github.io/is_sator_square)<br>
<!-- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first kata was based on a stone tablet found at Pompeii, known as a "sator square". It is an form of two dimentional palindrome admitting four symmetries. The coder of this kata must study the pattern of characters on the square and determine whether it conforms to the regulations of a sator square. -->

2 [build_square](https://rowcased.github.io/build_square)<br>
<!-- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This one was based on my experience playing with toy blocks with my daughter and as a kid myself. I simply created a challenge for the coder to determine if a square could be built out of the available different-sized blocks. -->

3 [mutations](https://rowcased.github.io/mutations)<br>
<!-- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kata was inspired by playing word games on road trips. This game involves altering a word by changing one letter. The coder is tasked with running a game between two fictional players who are trying to think up new words, such that the program determines the winner of the game. -->

* 1217 ~ number of members attempting my kata
* 340 ~ number correct solutions submitted
* 93.6% ~ average satisfaction rating

<h3 id="moderator"><br>4. Site Moderator</h3>

One of the greatest features of Codewars is that it is mostly maintained by an unofficial network of moderators (power-users) that have earned site privileges through earning honor points. However, members that abuse their authority can be banned. On any given day I may take part in a variety of activities to help maintain the site and improve its overall quality. 

* answer questions on the dashboard
* address suggestions made for kata
* directly edit live production code
* post issues on kata with faults
* resolve kata issues (often bogus)
* assist newer members debug their code
* vote on new beta kata submissions 
* rank new beta kata submissions
* report unethical / forbidden behavior
* approve new kata for use on site
* approve or reject kata translations
* repair & improve kata unit tests
